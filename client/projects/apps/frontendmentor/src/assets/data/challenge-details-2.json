    "brief": "Your challenge is to build out this product feedback application and get it looking as close to the design as possible.\n\nYou can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.\n\nWe provide the data in a local `data.json` file, so use that to populate the content on the first load. If you want to take it up a notch, feel free to build this as a full-stack application!\n\nYour users should be able to:\n\n- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size\n- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page\n- Create, read, update, and delete product feedback requests\n- Receive form validations when trying to create/edit feedback requests\n- Sort suggestions by most/least upvotes and most/least comments\n- Filter suggestions by category\n- Add comments and replies to a product feedback request\n- Upvote product feedback requests\n- **Bonus**: Keep track of any changes, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)\n- **Bonus**: Build this project as a full-stack application\n\nDownload the project and go through the `README.md` file. This will provide further details about the project and help you get set up.\n\nWant some support on the challenge?
