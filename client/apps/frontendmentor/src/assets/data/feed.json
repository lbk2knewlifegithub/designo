So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.\n\nYour users should be able to: \n\n- View the optimal layout for the page depending on their device's screen size\n- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page\n\nDownload the starter code and go through the `README.md` file. This will provide further details about the project. The `style-guide.md` file is where you'll find colors, fonts, etc.\n\nWant some support on the challenge? [Join our Slack community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/slack) and ask questions in the help channel.",
